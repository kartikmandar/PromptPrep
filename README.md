# PromptPrep

## Overview

**PromptPrep** aggregates all your programming-related code files from a specified directory into a single file with an ASCII directory tree. This is particularly useful when you want to provide your complete codebase to AI models or perform other analyses.

## Features

- **Directory Tree Generation**: Creates an ASCII representation of your directory structure (with configurable exclusions).
- **Code Aggregation**: Concatenates code from programming-related files into one master file.
- **Customizable Inclusions/Exclusions**: Specify which files or directories to include or omit.
- **CLI and API**: Use it directly from the command line or import classes/functions into your notebooks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
