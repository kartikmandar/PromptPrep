About promptprep
==============

Project History
-------------

promptprep was created to solve the common problem of preparing code for sharing with AI models like GPT-4. When seeking help with coding issues, it's often necessary to share multiple files to provide context, but copying and pasting each file individually is tedious and error-prone.

The project has evolved to become a versatile tool for code aggregation, documentation, and analysis, with features like incremental processing, diff generation, and interactive file selection.
